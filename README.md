## Procedural Rectangular Abstract art
[Live Demo](https://dattasid.github.io/rects_div.html)

This was an experiment in generating procedural art, that was random yet that humans would find them interesting. My theory was that images that contain patterns, repetition and symmetry would capture human attention. Hence this program randomly subdivides rectangles, and assigns them color. Sometimes the two subdivisions are copies of each other, adding repetition. Sometimes they are mirrors of each other, adding symmetry. Sometimes, the program will introduce "errors" in the copy, hopefully making it interesting.

Did it become art? Judge for yourself at the live demo!

## Procedural Seascapes
[Live Demo](https://dattasid.github.io/fish.html)

Created for Reddit's r/proceduralgeneration Cityscape challenge, this program draws dark brooding (evil?) buildings against a moody evening sky. The building can be rectangular, or polygonal, with varying window light patterns.

## Procedural insects
[Live Demo](https://dattasid.github.io/ProcInsect.html)

Created for Reddit's r/proceduralgeneration Procedural Creature challenge, this program creates insects with segmented body, legs and antenna. The body segments will have the familiar spiky squiggly edges that we love to hate. The body segments should appear very similar to each other in spite of varying in legth and width, so that the whole insect appears one consistent creature.
